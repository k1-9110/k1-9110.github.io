  <h1>Why does this exist?</h1>
  <p>Well, for many reasons, but the main one is becuase I want to have a simple website without all the modern, flashy details; something that's overall very simple, and straight to the point. Secondly, I just want to have a website to log my thoughts about governments and other such things. Also, free will.</p>
  <h1>Why use GitHub instead of another source?</h1>
  <p>Because I'm too poor to purchase my own domain for anything similar to this. I don't want to spend any money.</p>
