  <h1>Why does this exist?</h1>
  <p>Well, for many reasons, but the main one is becuase I want to have a simple website without all the modern, flashy details; something that's overall very simple, and straight to the point. Secondly, I just want to have a website to log my thoughts about governments and other such things, and also wanna be able to talk about whatever I want. Also, free will.</p>
  <h1>Why use GitHub instead of another source?</h1>
  <p>Because I'm too poor to purchase my own domain for anything similar to this. I don't want to spend any money.</p>

  <p>The government of the United States is horrible. They say they won't spy on you, but they spy on you in every single possible way that you can imagine, and it's pig-like behavior, it's disgusting in every way possible. It's not just that, they say, and literally say it, that they won't spy on the people of the United States because "it's unconstitutional and wrong to impose such things onto our people, we value their rights." They in fact do not value our rights in any possible way. The only reason that they even listen to anything we say or do in the first place is because of the Constitution of the United States, and if it was up to me, there'd be no filthy, wrong, nasty pig of a government. The form of capitalism that we have is terrible for people who are poor and/or with little money. If the USA were communist, things would be very different, but there's no telling if this would be good or not. Because of how the United States of America is with the whole world, America becoming communist would potentially be devastating for quite literally every nation. Many countries rely on the United States of America, and those countries have other countries that rely on them for things as well, and if the US loses what it does best, and falls apart, the whole world will fall apart. However, no one can truly tell what would fully happen if the US were to become communist. All that we know is that it would most likely be devastating to the rest of the world. And before you say to your screen "The US is the only country!," I know, dipstick, but understand that well over 200 countries rely on the United States. America may benefit first from socialism though, but then again, looking at how socialism and communism has worked in the past, eeehhh, this might not be the best option. While some people may say that communism and socialism would be way better for the world, I disagree. While America is difficult to get by sometimes, if it wasn't for capitalism, America probably wouldn't exist at all. Seriously, name one time where communism has stayed in full effect with no capitalist infusion. I'll wait, oh yeah! You can't. Capitalism has single handedly been the most solid economic belief ever, and there hasn't been any communist countries that've stayed communist. Some may argue that China is communist, but that's only true for their political beliefs, not their economy. They have a capitalist economy, and a Marxist political scene. Furthermore, the US government is terrible, and I've already said someting about this in the past, but I just need to reinforce it more! There's a lot of corruption in US politics, and often we've seen elections be rigged either by people in the US or by people from other countries, or entire countries in whole! I need not explain further how bad the political system of the United States of America truly is. We bring freedom (to some degree), but it has destroyed us in many ways. And a fun fact, a lot of the US government actually runs on Windows XP still. Like, genuinely running on an operating system that's over 20 years old now. They need to upgrade their systems. Me personally, I run Linux on all of my machines. Why? Because it's the superior operating system. I can do so much more on Linux than I can on any other operating system imaginable. Linux IS the superior OS.</p>
