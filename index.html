  <h1>Why does this exist?</h1>
  <p>Well, for many reasons, but the main one is becuase I want to have a simple website without all the modern, flashy details; something that's overall very simple, and straight to the point. Secondly, I just want to have a website to log my thoughts about governments and other such things. Also, free will.</p>
  <h1>Why use GitHub instead of another source?</h1>
  <p>Because I'm too poor to purchase my own domain for anything similar to this. I don't want to spend any money.</p>

  <p>The government of the United States is horrible. They say they won't spy on you, but they spy on you in every single possible way that you can imagine, and it's pig-like behavior, it's disgusting in every way possible.</p>
  <p>It's not just that, they say, and literally say it, that they won't spy on the people of the United States because "it's unconstitutional and wrong to impose such things onto our people, we value their rights." They in fact</p>
  <p>do not value our rights in any possible way. The only reason that they even listen to anything we say or do in the first place is because of the Constitution of the United States, and if it was up to me, there'd be no filthy, wrong, nasty pig of a government.</p>
