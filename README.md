# Why does this exist?
Well, for many reasons, but the main one is becuase I want to have a simple website without all the modern, flashy details; something that's overall very simple, and straight to the point. Secondly, I just want to have a website to log my thoughts about governments and other such things. Also, free will.

# Why use GitHub instead of another source?
Because I'm too poor to purchase my own domain for anything similar to this. I don't want to spend any money.
